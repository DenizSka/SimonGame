#### Simon Game  


***What is Simon?***

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. 

I choose to make this game mainly because I like memory games but also I figured this would be a good exercise for me to practice randomizing the series with each restart, adding complexity with each level and listening and recording the click events.


***Wireframes***

Please see the folder for wireframes. I was not able to add them here.

Initial thoughts on game structure


***Challenges: ***
Randomizing the series with each restart.
Adding one more box that lid up with each level (adding complexity). And keeping it random.
Tracking the users clicks and comparing them to the computer generates series.

***Ideas:***
Please note that the wireframe I used is for the basic Simon game. If I am able finish the game on time, here are the list of things I would like to add:
- More buttons with more colors. 
- Click sound for each user's 'click' and also music when the computer is showing the series.
- A scoreboard to store current users score. Mega Bonus: Maybe even keep track of the highest score so far.
- More complex landing page.


***Phases of Completion***

Phase 1 landing page: This will explaine the game.
Phase 2 beginning: You have press start for computer to generate a random series.
Phase 3 game state: Computer will generate a serie and stop. User will now have to repeat the same thing. 
Phase 4: If its correct, user should be notified that he/she is now on the next level.
Phase 5: Each step is harder than the previous one.
Phase 6 end state: You will either lose and it will say gameover or win (let's say there are 10 level in total) and a pop-up will say "congrats play again"
